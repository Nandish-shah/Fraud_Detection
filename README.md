## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to **detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset** using machine learning algorithms. Fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial industry, and this project aims to apply classification models to identify suspicious activity with a focus on **imbalanced datasets**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To apply machine learning techniques for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Understanding real-world fraud patterns and anomalies
- Handling highly **imbalanced datasets**
- Applying classification algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, etc.
- Evaluating model performance with metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and outlier detection

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional for visualization)

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

- Dataset Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- The dataset contains **anonymized features** and a **binary class label** (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)
- Highly imbalanced: Only ~0.17% of transactions are fraudulent

## ðŸ§ª Project Flow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
3. **Preprocessing**
   - Scaling features
   - Handling imbalance (via SMOTE or undersampling)
4. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve
   - Classification Report
